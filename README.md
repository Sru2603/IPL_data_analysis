# IPL_data_analysis
This project explores a comprehensive dataset of IPL matches, aiming to uncover trends, performance insights, and statistics about teams, players, and match events. Using Python, the analysis covers key areas:

1. Team Performance: Total runs by each team, average runs per inning, and team-specific trends, including highest averages and century counts.
2. Bowling and Extras: Analysis of wides, no balls, and overall extras by each bowling team, examining how these vary with overs and impact the game.
3. Player Highlights: Leading batsmen by runs, bowlers by wickets, and fielders involved in most dismissals, plus partnerships (batsman-bowler pairs) for detailed player performance insights.
4. In-Game Trends: Distribution of runs per over, dismissal kinds, and comparisons between regular innings and super overs.
5. Match-level Insights: Runs scored across overs, the relationship between runs and extras, and the dynamics of runs and dismissals across different innings and over numbers.

Each query is implemented in Python, providing a detailed view into team and individual performances, match characteristics, and statistical trends within IPL games.
